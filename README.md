# Harry-Potter-text-analysis
This repository is a PyTorch implementation of Stanford CS224n (Winter 2018) using Harry Potter texts. 

Note: This material is only for personal research/study.

All credits to the wonderful implementation in https://github.com/DSKSD/DeepNLP-models-Pytorch

First model is Skipgram (word2vec) implementation using only Naive Softmasx.
Second model is GloVe implementation.

The future material will include: Window classifier, RNN language model, CNN classifier, RecursiveNN for sentiment classification and many more. 

Feel free to pull requests!
